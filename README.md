# Ptah YDB provider

This repository owns the executable YDB provider for [Ptah #4204](https://github.com/stokaro/ptah/issues/4204).
It is under development. Row-table and index inspection is available; schema planning
and migration execution are not implemented yet.

The executable opens native YDB connections and reads row-table schemas
through the public Ptah SDK. It supports anonymous, URL user/password, and URL token authentication.
Session receipts contain the selected database and measured server version.
The implementation does not import the Ptah application module.

## Build and test

```sh
GOWORK=off go test -race ./...
GOWORK=off CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bin/ptah-plugin-ydb ./cmd/ptah-plugin-ydb
```

The executable requires the SDK's authenticated local subprocess bootstrap.
Run it through a Ptah SDK client rather than invoking it as a command-line tool.
The SDK dependency is pinned to a published experimental revision. There is no
`replace` directive or workspace dependency.

Live checks require an isolated test database. Schema tests create uniquely
named directories and tables and remove them afterward. Session tests only
read server metadata.

```sh
PTAH_YDB_TEST_URL='ydb://localhost:2136/local?go_balancer=disable' \
  GOWORK=off go test -race -tags integration ./integration -count=1 -v
```

The test servers enable `enable_vector_index`; the 26.2 fixture also enables
`enable_add_unique_index`. Fulltext creation is expected to be refused on 25.1.

CI runs this process test against YDB 25.1.4.7 and 26.2.1.14. It also rejects
host-module imports and local module replacements. These checks cover sessions, native row-table observations, offline
normalization, index implementation tables, and refusals for incomplete reads. They do not establish
planning or migration support.

## Connection addresses

Use `ydb://host:2136/database` or `ydbs://host:2135/database` for TLS.
`database`, `token`, and `go_balancer` are the supported query parameters.
A token and URL user/password cannot be combined. Unknown or repeated
parameters, conflicting database paths, and malformed values are refused.
Credentials travel in the session-open request and are omitted from receipts,
SDK addresses, and error diagnostics. Native errors currently report only the
failed operation, which limits diagnosis until structured redaction is added.

Session close releases both the SQL pool and its parent native driver, even
when the RPC context is canceled. Cleanup results are retained for repeated
closes. A process accepts at most 1,024 lifetime session handles; start a new
provider process when that bound is reached.

## Schema observations

Inspection reads the native scheme and table APIs. Common columns preserve
YDB type spelling, Decimal precision/scale, nullability, and key membership.
Provider-owned table properties retain key order, TTL, column families,
partitioning, storage settings, attributes, and access metadata. Column
properties retain family assignment and typed literal or sequence defaults.
The observations carry their complete native field definitions and digests.
Normalization works offline after the database session closes.

Schema selectors name exact directories relative to the selected database.
Use `/` for its root. An unfiltered read walks subdirectories. System
(dot-prefixed) directories are excluded; user tables are not excluded merely
because their names begin with a dot. Traversal and snapshot size are bounded.
Coverage names the inspected subjects only; it does not claim native-object
absence outside those subjects.

Unknown native fields and enum values are refused before JSON conversion.
Changefeeds need an additional child-object reader and currently
refuse the whole inspection. Column tables, other native object kinds, and
replication-owned tables also refuse. A failed traversal returns no snapshot.
These limitations preserve data for the remaining extraction work.

Observed property models use YDB's typed protocol definitions inside this
provider. The neutral SDK carries their envelopes. Common fields and runtime
statistics are excluded from property payloads; they cannot become a second
writable representation. Index observations preserve sync, async, unique, vector, prefixed vector,
and fulltext variants. The provider reads every kind-specific implementation
table, including its columns, keys, and partition settings; parent table
metadata alone does not expose those settings. Missing implementation tables
or non-ready indexes refuse inspection. An empty index facet records the
absence of indexes on that inspected table.

Index lists and implementation-table lists are sorted by name. Column and key
arrays retain their observed order. Desired
models, semantic comparisons, and planning are still pending.

## Native protocol generation

The upstream Go bindings lack some native index and sequence fields. The
provider's typed definitions preserve their native wire numbers; attribution
and the pinned upstream source are in `third_party/ydb/NOTICE.md`. Unsupported
fields remain errors. Runtime statistics are omitted from schema observations.

With protoc 35.1 on `PATH`, regenerate with:

```sh
sh scripts/generate-native-schema.sh
```

The Go generator is pinned in `go.mod`. CI regenerates these definitions and
requires an unchanged generated file.

## Extraction still required

The source reference is Ptah commit `7b4b19f49fadf03ce81def2f6168ea60b3261a71`.
The complete scope includes typed schema objects and facets, offline source
formats, normalization, comparison, planning, rendering, execution, migration
transactions/history/locks/logs/tags, capability detection, environment
credential sources, monitoring, and dev-database provisioning. The provider advertises only implemented inspection and normalization
services. The remaining capabilities stay unadvertised.

The host's embedded implementation still needs removal when these operations
are wired through this executable. Provider release workflows, default Ptah bundling,
and independent installation acceptance remain pending. No v1 stability or
full YDB support is claimed by this development state.
